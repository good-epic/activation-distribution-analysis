# activation-distribution-analysis
Analysis of post-residual activations from GPT2 small, medium, large and Pythia 160m, 410m, and 1b for sentences with pairs of subject:attribute. This was a research analysis. The code isn't designed to be particularly portable or reusable, but it should be relatively straightforward use if you have an Nvidia GPU in the environment where you're running this. This could be run all on CPU but would require some refactoring. Note the activation_distribution_calc.py file will take quite a while to run unless you edit the code and distribute it across a number of GPUs. I've included the data used and a requirements.txt with versions. I haven't tested but I would guess the version numbers don't need to be super strictly conformed to. Included just for full information. I ran this on an Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-46) with an Nvidia 3070Ti running Pop OS 22.04 LTS with CUDA 12.4.
